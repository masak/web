---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web.pm is an incubator for several related but independent web application
projects. It's united by one central goal: to bring web application crafting,
just like the rest of Perl 6, up-to-date with current practices that have
proven to work in other languages.

At the center of this group of projects sits the Web.pm core, a set of
modules that abstract over common tasks related to HTTP requests and responses.

Here are some other modules currently under the roof of Web.pm:

Astaire
    A Perl 6 port of Ruby's Sinatra. Think of it as abstracting away the
    upper parts of the web stack; the part above Web.pm core. With Astaire
    you can write a "hello world"-type web application in a few lines
    of Perl 6.

Squerl
    A nice implementation-independent SQL interface. Working with 'datasets'
    as its fundamental abstraction, Squerl allows you to construct and
    manipulate queries in a flexible way. Not really an ORM layer, it's more
    of an abstraction of SQL specifics and platform differences.

    Now moved into its own repo: https://github.com/supernovus/squerl/

Ratel
    A no-frills templating module. Write your HTML (or whatever), and inline
    Perl 6 code between a '[%' and a '%]'. Ratel will turn your template into
    executable Perl 6, which can then be used to generate the HTML.

Hitomi
    A bells-and-whistles templating module. Where Ratel is fast-and-loose,
    Hitomi aims for strictness and scalability. A modular system based on
    XML SAX streams, it allows for combining (X)HTML and Perl 6 code in the
    same template.

    This is now known as Hinges, and can be found in its own repository:
